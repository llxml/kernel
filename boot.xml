<desc>First-run orientation. Read this to get started with LLXML.</desc>

<instruction>
PREREQUISITES:
- Git must be installed and configured (git config user.name/email)

DO THIS NOW:

0. If you haven't read self.xml (in this kernel directory) yet, STOP and read it first.
   That file defines the format. You need it before continuing.

1. Check if META/ directory exists at the project root.

2. IF NO META/ EXISTS:
   Tell the user:
   "This kernel hasn't been booted yet. I can help you:
   - Set up the full development environment (for developing LLXML itself)
   - Create a harness spec for your own workflow
   Which do you want to tackle first? Or something else?"
   
   Wait for their response.
   
   FOR DEV SETUP: Read skills/project-structure.xml first, then follow the <dev_setup> section below.
   FOR HARNESS: Read skills/harness-building.xml and follow it.

3. IF META/ EXISTS:
   Tell the user:
   "Kernel is booted. Available skills:"
   Then LIST the filenames in skills/.
   Then ask: "What do you want to work on?"
   
   When they pick something, read that skill and follow it.
   If the skill doesn't exist, offer options:
   - "I can help you write that skill"
   - "Want to see the existing skills again?"
   - "Or we can do something else"

Do not summarize this skill. Do not explain what you're going to do. Just do it.
</instruction>

<dev_setup>
To boot the kernel into a self-developing project, you need to wrap it.

STEP 1: ASK WHERE
Ask the user: "Where do you want to set up the kernel? (default: ~/dev/kernel/)"
Let them change it if they want.

STEP 2: THE INCEPTION MOVE
1. Create the project directory
2. Create main/ subdirectory and initialize git:
   ```bash
   mkdir main && cd main && git init
   ```
3. Copy the kernel files into main/ (don't move — safer during setup)
4. Commit the kernel:
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "Initial kernel import"
   ```
5. Create stable/ worktree from main:
   ```bash
   git worktree add ../stable -b stable
   ```

STEP 3: CREATE STRUCTURE
Create these directories and files:

```
<project-root>/
├── ll.xml                 # manifest (use template below)
├── main/                  # git repo (working branch)
│   └── [kernel files]
├── stable/                # stable branch worktree (for distribution)
├── META/
│   ├── loader.xml         # core context (use template below)
│   ├── PROMPTS.md         # session prompts (use template below)
│   ├── tickets/
│   │   ├── todo/
│   │   ├── in-progress/
│   │   ├── review/
│   │   └── done/
│   ├── mail/
│   │   ├── inbox/
│   │   ├── read/
│   │   └── trash/
│   ├── logs/
│   ├── spec/              # architecture specs (<app>, <library>)
│   └── ctx/               # assembled context for AI sessions
│       ├── template.xml         # blank template
│       ├── cleanup-kickoff.xml  # boot cleanup session
│       └── harness-kickoff.xml  # harness creation session
```

STEP 4: SEED THE INBOX
Create two mail items in META/mail/inbox/:

`[DATE]-boot-cleanup.md`:
```markdown
# Boot Cleanup

The kernel was copied (not moved) during boot setup.

## Action
Delete the original kernel files/directory that was used as the source.
The kernel now lives in main/ — the original is no longer needed.

## Context
This is safe to do once you've verified the boot completed successfully.
```

`[DATE]-create-harness.md`:
```markdown
# Create Your Harness

Now that the kernel is booted, you need a harness — a context assembler that watches your files and outputs context for AI agents.

## Action
Read skills/harness-building.xml and create your harness spec.

## Questions to Consider
- What do you want to call it? (default: "harness", but you could name it something memorable)
- What stack will you build it in? (Rust, Node, Go, etc.)
- Do you want a UI or headless?

## Getting Started
Use ctx/harness-kickoff.xml to start a session focused on this.
```

STEP 5: CONFIRM
Tell the user: "Kernel is booted. You're ready to develop."
Note: "I've added two items to your inbox — a cleanup reminder and a prompt to create your harness."
Then list the available skills and ask what they want to work on.

<purpose>
Core context for LLXML meta-development. Boot creates this when setting up META/.
</purpose>

<what_is_llxml>
LLXML is a self-describing format with two primitives:
- `<self>` — describes itself
- `<skill>` — teaches processes

Everything else (document types, workflows, project structures) are skills built on these primitives. The kernel is domain-agnostic; software development is just the first application.

Read main/self.xml for the full spec.
</what_is_llxml>

<kernel_vs_meta>
**Kernel** (ships): self.txt, self.xml, boot.xml, skills/
**META** (emerges): loader.xml, tickets/, logs/, mail/, ctx/, spec/

The kernel is sufficient for regeneration. Given the kernel and an LLM, the entire meta-development environment can be recreated. Boot guides this process.
</kernel_vs_meta>

<origin>
The seed (self.txt):
```
The language of a language that can describe and improve itself.
Any implementation satisfying this principle is valid.
```

LLXML is one implementation. Others could exist (LLYAML, LLJSON, etc.).
