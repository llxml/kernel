Use when verifying LLXML coverage against source documentation. Methodology for
identifying gaps between what's documented in LLXML and what exists in source.
</desc>

<tools>
- Source documentation (PLAN.md, README, docs/)
- LLXML specification files
- grep/ripgrep for searching
</tools>

<audit_process>
<step_1>
Identify source of truth:
- PLAN.md for project requirements
- README for library usage
- docs/ for detailed documentation
- Source code for implementation details
</step_1>

<step_2>
Extract all documentable items from source:
- Features and capabilities
- Data types and structures
- Workflows and processes
- Constraints and requirements
- Integration patterns
- Generated files warnings
</step_2>

<step_3>
Compare against LLXML coverage:
For each item, determine status:
- Covered: Fully documented in LLXML
- Partial: Mentioned but incomplete
- Missing: Not in LLXML at all
</step_3>

<step_4>
Document findings:
Create audit report with:
- Item name
- Source location
- LLXML location (if any)
- Coverage status
- Notes on gaps
</step_4>

<step_5>
Prioritize gaps:
- Critical: Core functionality missing
- Important: Key workflows incomplete
- Minor: Nice-to-have details
</step_5>
</audit_process>

<status_categories>
<covered>
Item is fully documented in LLXML with:
- Accurate description
- Complete details
- Correct location
- Up-to-date information
</covered>

<partial>
Item exists in LLXML but:
- Missing important details
- Outdated information
- Incomplete workflow
- Lacks examples
</partial>

<missing>
Item not in LLXML at all:
- No mention anywhere
- Referenced but not defined
- Exists only in source
</missing>
</status_categories>

# LLXML Audit Report

## Summary
- Total items: N
- Covered: X
- Partial: Y
- Missing: Z

## Findings

### Covered Items
| Item | Source | LLXML Location |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Feature A | PLAN.md:45 | META/spec/app.xml:<features> |

### Partial Coverage
| Item | Source | LLXML Location | Gap |
|------|--------|----------------|-----|
| Workflow B | docs/USAGE.md | META/spec/app.xml:<workflow> | Missing step 3 |

### Missing Items
| Item | Source | Priority | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Feature C | PLAN.md:78 | Critical | Core functionality |
```

<blind_audit>
For unbiased coverage assessment:

1. Read ONLY the source documentation first
2. Extract all items without looking at LLXML
3. Then compare against LLXML
4. This prevents confirmation bias

The auditor should not have written the LLXML being audited.
</blind_audit>

<common_gaps>
<library_specific>
Often missing from app specs:
- Library workflow details
- Generated files warnings
- Integration patterns
- Error handling
</library_specific>

<process_gaps>
Often incomplete:
- Step-by-step workflows
- Decision points
- Error recovery
- Edge cases
</process_gaps>

<type_gaps>
Often missing:
- Nested type definitions
- Enum variants
- Optional field semantics
- Map key/value types
</type_gaps>
</common_gaps>

<resolution>
After audit, address gaps by:
1. Creating missing library specs (if library-specific)
2. Updating app spec with missing features
3. Adding missing skills/rules
4. Referencing library specs via `<deps>` section
</resolution>
