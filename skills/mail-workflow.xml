<desc>Async message queue for items needing attention.</desc>

<structure>
```
META/mail/
  inbox/    # unprocessed
  read/     # processed, kept for reference
  trash/    # discarded, ~30 day retention
```

File format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-slug.md`
</structure>

<format>
```markdown
# Title

Brief description.

## Context
- Source, relevance, related files

## Questions
- Clarifying questions, options to consider
```

One topic per item. Split if too big.
</format>

<sources>
- Human scratch files (backlog, notes, etc.) — process into mail items
- Cross-project — bugs in vendored libs go to that project's mail
- Agent discoveries — bugs, missing features, tech debt
</sources>

<processing>
1. Read and understand
2. Decide: ticket, quick-fix, defer, or discard
3. Take action
4. **Move** (not copy) to `read/` or `trash/` with disposition

**CRITICAL**: Use `mv`, never `cp`. Item must exist in exactly ONE directory.
```bash
mv META/mail/inbox/{item}.md META/mail/read/
ls META/mail/inbox/{item}.md  # should fail: No such file
```

When moving to `read/`, append:
```markdown
---

## Marked as Read

**Disposition**: ticket | quick-fix | defer | discard
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Notes**: What was decided
**Ticket**: META/tickets/todo/slug.md (if applicable)
```
</processing>

<outcomes>
- **Ticket** → `META/tickets/todo/`, item to `read/`
- **Quick fix** → implement directly, item to `read/`
- **Decompose** → split into multiple inbox items
- **Defer** → note reason, move to `read/`
- **Discard** → move to `trash/`
</outcomes>

<cleanup>
Trash items deleted after ~30 days: `find META/mail/trash -mtime +30 -delete`
</cleanup>
