<desc>Creating and iterating on objective files for task planning</desc>

<tools>
- `META/objectives/` directory
- `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"` for timestamps
- TodoWrite/TodoRead tools for execution tracking
</tools>

<file_format>
```markdown
# OBJECTIVE
Single sentence describing the goal.

Brief context paragraph explaining background and motivation.

# CODE SNIPPETS
Suggested implementation patterns with syntax highlighting.

# IMPORTANT NOTES
- Architectural constraints
- Dependencies to preserve
- Performance considerations

# TASK LIST
- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation
  - [ ] Specific actionable task with `main/file/path.rs`
  - [ ] Another task
- [ ] Phase 2: Implementation
  - [ ] ...

<naming>
`YYYYMMDD-HHMM-description.md`

Examples:
- `20251205-1430-adapter-consolidation.md`
- `20251206-0915-webrtc-signaling.md`
</naming>

<steps>
1. Get timestamp: `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"`
2. Create file: `META/objectives/YYYYMMDD-HHMM-description.md`
3. Write objective with:
   - Clear single-sentence goal
   - Context paragraph
   - Code snippets (if applicable)
   - Important notes with constraints
   - Hierarchical task list with file paths
4. Present to user for review and iteration
5. Once approved, copy tasks to TodoWrite tool
6. Execute tasks, marking complete as you go
7. Run tests after code changes
8. Send completion notification: `notify-send "Objective" "Work Completed"`
</steps>

<task_rules>
- Tasks must be actionable (can be checked off when done)
- Include exact file paths in backticks (relative to project root)
- Use action verbs: Create, Update, Implement, Test
- Include unit test tasks for all code changes
- Non-actionable info goes in Important Notes, not tasks
- Always end with completion notification task
</task_rules>

<objectives_vs_tickets>
- **Objectives**: Planning documents for exploration, design, broad work
- **Tickets**: Claimable work units bound to a feature branch and worktree

Use objectives for planning and iteration with the user. Use tickets when work is well-defined and ready to be claimed and executed in isolation.
