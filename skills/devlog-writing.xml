<desc>Writing development log entries for session handoffs and progress tracking</desc>

<tools>
- `META/logs/` directory
- `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"` for timestamps
</tools>

<naming>
`YYYYMMDD-HHMM-description.md`

Examples:
- `20251205-1430-webrtc-integration-complete.md`
- `20251206-0915-relay-server-refactor.md`
</naming>

<style>
- Write for an expert audience
- Be concise but capture important details
- Include file references with line numbers: `main/src/module/file.ext:42`
- Use mermaid diagrams where they add clarity
- No fluff or preamble
</style>

<structure>
```markdown
# Summary
One paragraph describing what was accomplished.

# Changes
- `main/src/module/file.ext` - What changed and why
- `main/src/other/file.ext:123` - Specific line reference

# Architecture Decisions
Why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives.

# Open Questions
Unresolved issues or decisions for next session.

# Next Steps
What should happen next.
```
</structure>

<steps>
1. Get timestamp: `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"`
2. Create file: `META/logs/YYYYMMDD-HHMM-description.md`
3. Write summary of work completed
4. List specific file changes with paths (relative to project root)
5. Document any architectural decisions made
6. Note open questions or blockers
7. Outline next steps for handoff
</steps>

<when_to_write>
- End of a work session
- After completing a major objective or ticket
- When handing off to another agent/session
- When encountering a significant blocker
- After making architectural decisions that need documentation
</when_to_write>
